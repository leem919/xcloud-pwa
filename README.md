I am no longer developing this as [Better xCloud](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud) is the best option for a better user experience and the official PWA has been available on all platforms for some time. I will keep the code up and unarchived.

# Xbox Cloud Gaming PWA
Wrapper for xcloud

This was originally made because the official PWA wasn't avaiable for android mobile devices, only iPhones and iPads. It became a small attempt at improving upon some of the functionality.

After testing this PWA with several mobile browsers, I've determined that installing it through the Samsung Internet Browser seems to be the best for its functionality, but Google Chrome is a close second. No other mobile browsers currently have proper PWA support, so you have to use one of those two to properly install this.
# Install
The app is live at https://leem919.github.io/xcloud-pwa/ to install.
