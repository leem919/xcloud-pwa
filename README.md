As of 9/29/22, I've noticed that Microsoft made their xcloud pwa available for more platforms now, and that this pwa is probably useless. However, I choose to continue working on it simply because I want to make mine look good and integrate better with androids.
# xcloud-pwa
For non-apple mobiles

On iPhones and iPads, the xcloud website is installed as an app on the home screen, which I think is very efficient and clean. However, on my android the same doesn't apply, and it bothered me. So after a mess of copying and pasting, I came up with this solution to install xcloud as an app on pretty much any mobile device. I'm happy to accept improvements since I threw this together quite quickly to just make it work for now.

After testing the pwa with several mobile browsers, I find that installing it through the Samsung Internet Browser seems to be the best for performance and looks, Google Chrome is a close second. No other mobile browsers currently have proper pwa support, so you'll want to use one of the two I mentioned.
# Install
The app is live at https://leem919.github.io/xcloud-pwa/ for you to install and try out.
