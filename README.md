# Xbox Cloud Gaming PWA
Wrapper for xcloud

Originally I made this project because the official PWA wasn't avaiable for android mobile devices, only iPhones and iPads. However that's not the case anymore, so now I'm mainly maintaining this PWA because it's a fun project to try to improve, and I would like to do the best I can to make the user experience better.

After testing the PWA with several mobile browsers, I find that installing it through the Samsung Internet Browser seems to be the best for its functionality, but Google Chrome is also close second. No other mobile browsers currently have proper PWA support, so you'll want to use one of the two I mentioned.
# Install
The app is live at https://leem919.github.io/xcloud-pwa/ for you to install and try out.
