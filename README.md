# xcloud-pwa
For non-apple mobiles

On iPhones and iPads, the xcloud website is installed as an app on the home screen, which I think is very efficient and clean. However, on android the same doesn't apply, and it bothered me. So after a mess of copying and pasting, I came up with this solution to install xcloud as an app on pretty much every device, though I find it works best on mobile browsers, which is what I wanted it for anyways.
